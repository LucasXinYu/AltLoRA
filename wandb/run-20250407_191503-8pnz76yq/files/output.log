['### Instruction: Please answer with one of the option in the bracket\n\n### Input:\nQ:A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician\'s office because she is concerned about his feeding habits. He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color. On physical exam, the child\'s abdomen is minimally distended but no other abnormalities are appreciated. Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation?? \n{\'A\': \'Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud\', \'B\': \'Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize\', \'C\': \'Error in neural crest cell migration\', \'D\': \'Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus\', \'E\': \'Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline\'},\n\n### Response:\nAns:D\nExplanation:\n\nThe pyloric sphincter (P) develops from an invagination at the junction between the gastric mucosa (G) and duodenal mucosa (D). As it grows down, it becomes surrounded by muscle fibers that form a ring around its circumference.\nDuring development, a large portion of the stomach migrates downward over the anterior abdominal wall. The area where these structures meet forms what is known as the "pyloric canal." At birth, the pylore valve orifice remains open allowing for continuous flow into the small intestine.\n\nWhen there is insufficient space available within the developing alimentary tract to accommodate the growing fetus, the entire gastrointestinal system may be affected. This condition can cause serious health issues such as gastroschisis or omphalocele.\n• Gastroschisis occurs when part of the digestive system protrudes through an abnormal opening on either side of the umbilical cord. It usually affects males more frequently than females. Most cases occur during early pregnancy after implantation takes place inside utero; however, some women give birth prematurely due to premature rupture of membranes resulting in exposure to amniotic fluid.\n• Omphalocele refers to herniation of internal organs including liver bile ducts intestines colon spleen pancreas kidneys gallbladder adrenal glands ovaries testicles uterus fallopian tubes vagina cervix clitoris labia majora minora penis scrotum perineum anus rectum anal canal vaginal cavity uterosacral ligament round ligaments broad ligament infundibulum pelvic floor diaphragm thorax sternum ribs intercostals muscles abdominopelvic fascial planes parietes mesentery omentum greater momentum lesseromentum transverse colonic fold sigmoid colon descending colon cecum ascending colon hepatic flexure splenic flexure caudate lobe left kidney right kidney urinary bladder ureter urogenital sinus external genitalia skin subcutaneous tissue myofascial layer fat layer muscularis externa serosal surface blood vessels lymphatics nerve endings nerves visceral pleura pulmonary parenchyma mediastinal contents heart great vessels roots of lungs tracheobronchial tree bronchioles alveolar sacs airspaces gas exchange capillaries hemoglobin erythrocytes oxygen carbon dioxide bicarbonate chloride potassium sodium magnesium phosphorus calcium hydrogen sulfide ammonia methionine cysteine tyrosine phenylalanine histidine lysine arginine tryptophan threonine valine leucine isooleucine glutamine alanine proline glycine serine asparagine glutamate hydrochloric acid pepsin gastrin enterogastrone cholecystokinin secretin motilin vasoactive intestinal peptide somatostatin glucagon insulin growth hormone prolactin thyroxine triiodothyronine cortisol aldosterone adrenocorticotropic hormone antidiuretic hor mone oxytocin vasopressin thyroid stimulating hormone follicle-stimulating hormone luteinizing hormone chorionic gonadotropin placental lactogen estradiol progesterone estriol testosterone dihydrotestosterone deoxycortisol corticotroph releasing factor melanocyte concentrating hormone neuropeptide Y neurotensin enkephalin endorphins dynorphins serotonin dopamine norepinephrine epinephrine acetylcholine muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors GABA receptors NMDA receptors AMPA receptors kainate receptors metabotropic glutamate receptors opioids cannabinoid receptors opioid peptides morphiceps endomorphins nocistats somatosensory neurons viscerosomatic pathways trigeminothalamic pathway autonomic nervous system sympathetic division parasympathetic']
