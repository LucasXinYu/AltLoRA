Q:A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient??

Q:A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient??
{'A': 'Ampicillin', 'B': 'Ceftriaxone', 'C': 'Ciprofloxacin', 'D': 'Doxycycline', 'E': 'Nitrofurantoin'},

Q:A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits. He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color.

Q:A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient??

Q:A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits. He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color.

The foregut gives rise to the stomach and proximal part of small intestine (duodenum), while most of the rest of the small bowel comes from the midgut.\n\nIn humans, it can be difficult for the intestines to migrate into their proper positions. Therefore, they may end up being misplaced or folded on top of each other as seen here.\n\n\nFigure above shows normal development of the gut tube. During gastrulation at about day 21, the dorsal mesentery will develop around the intestinal tube forming loops. At the same time the midgut herniates through an opening between the umbilicus and liver which closes off by week 8 leaving only a remnant called the omphalo-mesenteric duct. These processes leave some potential space within the peritoneal cavity, allowing organs such as spleen to occupy these areas.\n\n\n\nSo when there is abnormal folding of parts of the gastrointestinal tract, then these malformations can occur resulting in various conditions like malrotation etc.\n\n\n\n\nVomiting due to congenital anomalies involving upper GI tract occurs more commonly during first few months of life whereas lower GI obstruction causes delayed onset of symptoms after birth typically beyond six weeks\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n1) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917952/\n"]
